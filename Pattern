Problem Statement -

Ninja loves playing with numbers. So one day, he wants to arrange a few numbers in the ‘N’ number of rows. The first row contains 1 number, the second row has two numbers, and so on.

On row 1, he places ‘1’. From the second row, he puts a number equal to one less than the number of the row at two ends of the row and places zeros in between.

You are given an integer ‘N’ denoting the given number of rows. Can you print the pattern Ninja wants to create?

Pattern for N = 4:

1
11
202
3003
Input Format:
The first line contains ‘T’, denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single integer ‘N’, denoting the number of rows.
Output Format:
For each test case, print a string denoting the required pattern in the following ‘N’ lines.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^2
Where ‘T’ denotes number of test cases and ‘N’ is the given integer denoting the given number of rows.
